This is my university project for java course. The project purpose is to build a simple Airline Ticket Purchasing System which will take input from cmd and also show it to cmd.
I have uploaded all the java classes associated with this project. RootClass.java is the main class file used for this project. You can also see the attached screenshots where 
you can get the view of that mini project.

N.B: The files attached here might seem unsorterd.
